# 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) to forecast daily maximum temperature values using past historical data

Introduction:
Time series forecasting is a crucial task in data science with wide applications in
weather prediction, stock markets, energy usage, and health monitoring. In this
project, we focus on predicting future temperature values using deep learning
techniques, specifically a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). Deep
learning models, particularly CNNs and RNNs, are data-driven approaches that can
model complex, non-linear relationships in sequential data. Among these, 1D CNNs
have the advantage of being computationally efficient and capable of learning local
temporal dependencies


Objective:
To design and train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) to forecast daily
maximum temperature values using past historical data, based on a time series
sequence model. The data is loaded from a .csv file and used to build a supervised
learning dataset with sequential inputs.
